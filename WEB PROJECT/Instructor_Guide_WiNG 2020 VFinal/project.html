        <h3>5.1 Get Organized</h3>
        <p>Tips for students to organize themselves so they can participate in the program and not be overwhelmed.</p>

        <h3><i>5.1.1. Learning Activity 1 Get Organized</i></h3>
        <i>Instructions</i>
        <ol>
            <li>Break the class into several small group and have them discuss each strategy to see how it can be used
                in
                the program.</li>
            <li>Ask each group to choose one person to take notes, and then share their ideas with the class.</li>
        </ol>


        <h3>5.2. Talk to Your Instructors</h3>

        <h3><i>5.2.1. Your Learning Starts With YOU</i></h3>
        <p>This section speaks to the need for students to effectively communicate with the instructor if and when they
            don’t understand something or feel they are falling behind. It should be emphasized that this communication
            also
            needs to be done in a timely fashion – i.e. when a problem first arises – and not days or weeks later. </p>

        <h3><i>5.2.2. Tips for communicating with your instructor</i></h3>
        <p>A reminder for students that you as their instructor, are there to help them. Convey to them that they should
            view the instructor as an ally rather than an authority figure. The section then lays out some basic ground
            rules that will ensure there is effective and respectful communications between the students and the
            instructor,
            as well as between the students themselves.</p>

        <h3><i>5.2.3 Learning Activity 2 Talking to Your Instructor</i></h3>
        <p>You are going to take turns being the instructor and the student.</p><br>
        <i>Instructions</i>
        <ol>
            <li>Ask the student to find a partner to work with.</li>
            <li>With their partner, ask them to practice asking questions that they may have about the course. </li>
            <li>Note, that the partner might not know the answer but can give you feedback on whether your question is
                clear, whether you have introduced yourself, etc.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>5.3. Come to Class Prepared</h3>
        <p>Introduces the students to a broader, more inclusive interpretation of what being prepared means, and its
            importance in enhancing a student’s learning experience. Looks at both physical and mental preparation for
            learning.</p>

        <h3><i>5.3.1 Learning Activity 3 Superhero Pose</i></h3>
        <p>The following activity can help lower blood pressure, increases oxygen in the body, and helps a person feel
            relaxed and more confident. It takes only minutes but can make the difference in their day. Even if they are
            already running late and are stressed – suggest they take the extra two minutes in the hall to do this for
            themself. They will be more prepared to learn.</p>
        <i>Instructions</i>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Ask students to stand and find a space in the room where they are not distracted by others; ask them to
                face
                the wall.
            </li>
            <li>
                Have them stand with your feet, shoulder width apart, hands on their hips, elbows out wide.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ask them to lift their chin and drop their shoulders.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once in position, instruct them to breathe slowly but deeply for 10 breaths, in through the nose, out
                through the mouth.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>If students are interested in learning more about how power posing can boost your confidence, suggest they
            check
            out this TEDTalk video (20 minutes,
            48 seconds).</p>

        <h3>5.4. Understand Your Learning Style and Develop Your Skills</h3>
        <p>
            This section brings attention to the fact that people have quite different learning styles that are often,
            but
            not always, related to the culture they were raised in.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bring to the students’ attention that some cultures adhere to very structured and formal styles of learning
            where students are not encouraged to speak up or question their teachers. Others learn through storytelling
            and
            sharing, while other learn by doing. These can also be intertwined with each other.
        </p>
        <p>
            The students are then introduced o the three basic types of learning styles: auditory, visual, and tactile.
            Note
            that they may lean towards only one style or all three.
        </p>


        <h3><i>5.4.1 Auditory Learners</i></h3>
        <p>Provides a more detailed explanation of what an auditory learner is and provides some suggestions of things
            that
            auditory learners can do to learn better.</p>

        <h3><i>5.4.2. Visual Learners</i></h3>
        <p>Provides a more detailed explanation of what a visual learner is and provides some suggestions of things that
            visual learners can do to learn better.</p>

        <h3><i>5.4.3. Tactile Learners</i></h3>
        <p>Provides a more detailed explanation of what a tactile learner is and provides some suggestions of things
            that
            tactile learners can do to learn better.</p>

        <h3><i>5.4.4. Learning Activity 4 Learning Types</i></h3>

        <i>Instructions</i>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Break the class into several small groups.
            </li>
            <li>
                Have the students talk with their classmates about what kind of learner they think they might be.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ask them to try to draw a diagram that shows how the different learning styles are present in your
                class.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the students have identified their primary learning style (and perhaps a secondary one), organize
                the
                students in the room by their primary style, then their secondary style.
            </li>
            <li>
                Have each learning group show the differences and similarities.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>5.5. Participate. Be on time. Be present.</h3>
        <h3><i>5.5.1 Participate respectfully </i></h3>
        <p>
            This section describes different ways for students to participate in discussions. The intent is to raise
            awareness of the different ways and help students to help themselves and others participate in discussions.
        </p>

        <h3>5.6. Conclusion</h3>
        <p>This section connects the strategies and tips for successful participation in the program to application for
            success elsewhere, where it is looking for work or working in the natural das industry or any industry.</p>
        <p>Highlight that there is no better time to start practicing being on-time, prepared, and present, than in this
            program. </p>

        <h3>7. Notes</h3>

        <h2 id="Module 2.1">Lesson Plan: Module 2.1 Introduction to Natural Gas</h2>
        <h3>1. Overview</h3>
        <h3>1.1. Welcome</h3>
        <p>
            Module 2.1 introduces the WiNG program, highlighting the broad range of employment and business
            opportunities,
            the industry offers British Columbians, and the importance of becoming energy literate in order to
            participate
            effectively and benefit from the industry’s growth in the future. The balance of the module describes
            natural
            gas and the history of its development as an energy source.
        </p>

        <h3>1.2. Energy Employment and Business Opportunities</h3>
        <p>A brief overview of the broad range of business opportunities and challenging, well-paying jobs and career
            paths
            natural gas and LNG energy sectors offer British Columbians. </p>
        <p>
            This is one of the three main objectives of the WiNG Program. Highlights that jobs and careers can be both
            directly in the natural gas industry, or indirect – through employment working for firms or organizations
            that
            services, supplies, or regulates the natural gas industry. In addition, students should understand that
            there
            are also plenty of opportunities for entrepreneurs in business and commerce related to the production,
            transportation, and distribution of natural gas and LNG, and also in providing products and services to the
            people living in communities where natural gas is extracted, processed and shipped.
        </p><br>

        <h3>1.3. Energy Literacy</h3>
        <p>
            This is the second of the three main objectives of the WiNG Program. In addition to helping students better
            understand how to find work in the industry, the WiNG program will help them become more <b>Energy
                Literate</b>,
            by increasing their understanding of what natural gas is, how it is produced, and what type of economic
            contribution the industry makes to the province and the country.
        </p>

        <h3>1.4. Industry Community Literacy</h3>
        <p>
            This is third of the three main objectives of the WiNG Program. The intent is to enhance students’
            appreciation
            that British Columbia is a diverse province and the natural gas industry works across, and in many regions
            and
            communities. The natural gas industry employs people from a wide range of places and backgrounds. It is
            important to understand how these different people and communities, including those on First Nations
            territories, in remote and urban locations, operate.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Learning Outcomes</h3>
        <i>When you complete this module, you will be able to:</i>
